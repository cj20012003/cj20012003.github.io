<h2 style="font-family: courier;">What kind of hamster?</h2>
<p style="font-family: Courier;"> Scar is a syrian hamster that i have raised since he was a baby,scar is offspring from the hamster i had before him.
    <br>
he is a very social hamster that likes to get picked up at night and loves to run around in his hamsterwheel.
    <br> 
Scar is also very friendly as he has never ever bitten me, he pushes me away with his nose if he is not in the mood to play tho.
<br>
<br>
In the picture below you can see scar when he was a baby.</p>

<p style="font-family: courier;"> Well in all honesty all he does is eat,sleep and runs around.</p>
